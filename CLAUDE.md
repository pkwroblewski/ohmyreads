# CLAUDE.md - Development Workflow Instructions

## Workflow

1. **Think through the problem** - Read the codebase for relevant files
2. **Write a plan** to `tasks/todo.md`
3. **Check in with the user** - Verify the plan before starting work
4. **Execute the plan** - Work on todo items, marking them complete as you go
5. **Explain changes** - Provide high-level explanations at every step
6. **Add review section** - Summarize changes in `tasks/todo.md`

---

## Core Principles

### Simplicity First
- Make every task and code change **as simple as possible**
- Avoid massive or complex changes
- Every change should impact **as little code as possible**
- Everything is about **SIMPLICITY**

### No Laziness
- **DO NOT BE LAZY. NEVER BE LAZY.**
- If there is a bug, find the **ROOT CAUSE** and fix it
- **NO TEMPORARY FIXES**
- You are a **SENIOR DEVELOPER**

### Minimal Impact
- Make all fixes and code changes **as simple as humanly possible**
- Only impact code **relevant to the task** and nothing else
- Impact **as little code as possible**
- Goal: **DO NOT INTRODUCE ANY BUGS**

## Todo File Format

Create plans in `tasks/todo.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]

## Plan
- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
- [ ] Step 3

## Review
_Summary of changes made and any relevant information_
```
